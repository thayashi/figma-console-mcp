# Figma MCP vs. Figma Console MCP

They share three letters in common. That's about where the similarities end.

If you've seen a LinkedIn post where someone generates a full UI component inside Figma using natural language — and the caption says "Figma MCP" — there's a good chance they're actually using **Figma Console MCP**. The naming confusion is real, and it's creating a lot of wrong assumptions about what each tool can do.

This article sets the record straight.

## The Short Version

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Figma MCP (Official)" icon="figma">
    **Made by Figma, Inc.** — A design-to-code bridge. Reads your Figma designs and translates them into code. Think of it as a one-way window: code looks at design.

    13 tools. REST API. Closed source.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Figma Console MCP" icon="terminal">
    **Made by Southleft** — A full design system API. Reads, writes, creates, debugs, and manages your entire Figma file programmatically. Think of it as a two-way door: code and design flow both directions.

    Full local tool surface. Plugin API + REST API. Open source (MIT).

## How They Connect to Figma

The biggest architectural difference is *how* each server talks to Figma — and this determines everything they can and can't do.

| | Figma MCP (Official) | Figma Console MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **Connection method** | Figma REST API (cloud) | Desktop Bridge runtime + REST API |
| **Runs where** | Figma's cloud (`mcp.figma.com`) or Desktop App | Your machine (`npx`) or self-hosted cloud |
| **Plugin API access** | No | Yes — full `figma.*` API |
| **Authentication** | OAuth (browser popup) | Local: PAT. Cloud write relay: PAT + pairing code. Remote SSE: OAuth |
| **Source code** | Closed source | Open source (MIT) |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP | daemon-backed local CLI / HTTP / MCP, plus remote SSE/HTTP |

**Why this matters:** The Figma REST API is read-only for design data. You can fetch file structures, component metadata, and export images — but you cannot create a rectangle, change a fill color, or add a variable. The Plugin API can do all of that and more.

Figma Console MCP's Desktop Bridge plugin runs *inside* Figma, giving AI assistants the same power as any Figma plugin — create nodes, modify properties, manage variables, listen for events. The official Figma MCP does not have this capability.

## Capability Comparison

### Design Reading

Both servers can read your Figma designs, but with different depth and mechanisms.

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Read file structure and document tree | Yes | Yes |
| Get component metadata and properties | Yes | Yes |
| Export visual screenshots | Yes | Yes |
| Read design tokens / variables | Yes | Yes |
| Read styles (color, text, effects) | Yes | Yes |
| Get layer hierarchy (names, IDs, types) | Yes | Yes |
| Read Code Connect mappings | Yes | No |
| Export variables as CSS / Tailwind / Sass / TypeScript | No | Yes |
| Full design system extraction in one call | No | Yes |
| Design system health scoring (Lighthouse-style) | No | Yes |
| Per-variant color token analysis | No | Yes |
| Component reconstruction specification | No | Yes |

### Design Writing and Creation

This is where the two tools diverge most dramatically.

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Execute arbitrary Plugin API code | No | Yes |
| Create frames, shapes, text nodes | No | Yes |
| Create components and component sets | No | Yes |
| Modify auto-layout properties | No | Yes |
| Set fill colors and strokes | No | Yes |
| Resize and move nodes | No | Yes |
| Clone and delete nodes | No | Yes |
| Set text content on text nodes | No | Yes |
| Create child nodes inside containers | No | Yes |
| Arrange component sets with native visualization | No | Yes |
| Import rendered web UI as flat design layers | Yes | No |
| Generate FigJam diagrams from Mermaid syntax | Yes | No |

<Note>
Figma MCP's `generate_figma_design` tool captures a *rendered web page* and imports it as flat design layers — it doesn't programmatically create design elements. Figma Console MCP's `figma_execute` runs actual Plugin API JavaScript, meaning anything a Figma plugin can do, the AI can do.
</Note>

### Variable and Token Management

| Capability | Figma MCP | Console MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Read variables and token values | Yes | Yes |
| Create individual variables | No | Yes |
| Update variable values | No | Yes |
| Delete variables | No | Yes |
| Rename variables | No | Yes |
| Create variable collections | No | Yes |
| Delete variable collections | No | Yes |
| Add modes (Light, Dark, Mobile, etc.) | No | Yes |
| Rename modes | No | Yes |
| Batch create variables (up to 100/call) | No | Yes |
| Batch update variables (up to 100/call) | No | Yes |
| Atomic design token system setup | No | Yes |

<Tip>
Figma Console MCP has **11 dedicated tools** for variable and token management. Batch operations are 10-50x faster than individual calls. The `figma_setup_design_tokens` tool creates an entire token system — collection, modes, and up to 100 variables — in a single atomic operation.

## When to Use Which

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Figma MCP When...">
    ### The official MCP is the right choice when:

    - **You want design-to-code translation** — `get_design_context` returns structured code-ready output in your framework of choice
    - **You need Code Connect integration** — mapping Figma components to existing code components is a first-party workflow
    - **You want zero setup** — the remote server at `mcp.figma.com` requires no local installation
    - **You're working with FigJam** — reading and creating diagrams with Mermaid syntax
    - **You want to capture live web UI into Figma** — `generate_figma_design` imports rendered pages as design layers
    - **You want design system rules** — auto-generating rule files for consistent AI code output
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use Console MCP When...">
    ### Figma Console MCP is the right choice when:

    - **You want AI to create designs in Figma** — components, layouts, prototypes, all through natural language
    - **You manage design tokens** — create, update, batch, and organize variables at scale
    - **You need real-time awareness** — knowing what the user selected, what changed, what page they're on
    - **You're building or debugging Figma plugins** — console logs, screenshots, live reload
    - **You want design-code parity analysis** — automated comparison across 8 dimensions
    - **You want to instantiate components** — place design system components with property overrides
    - **You need AI-complete component documentation** — anatomy, variants, tokens, content guidelines
    - **You don't want rate limits** — unlimited usage, self-hosted if needed
    - **You want open source** — audit the code, contribute, extend, self-host
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use Both Together">
    ### The best workflow uses both

    They're complementary, not competitive:

    1. **Design phase**: Use Figma Console MCP to create and manage design tokens, build component variants, and organize your design system
    2. **Handoff phase**: Use Figma MCP to generate framework-specific code from those designs, with Code Connect ensuring the right existing components are used
    3. **Maintenance phase**: Use Figma Console MCP's parity analysis to catch drift between design and code, then use Figma MCP's design system rules to keep AI code generation consistent

    Both servers can be configured in the same MCP client simultaneously.

## A Note on Credit

We see the LinkedIn posts. We see the YouTube videos. Someone uses Figma Console MCP to generate a full login screen inside Figma, complete with auto-layout and design tokens — and the caption says "Look what Figma MCP can do!"

We get it. The names are confusingly similar. And honestly? Figma MCP walked so Figma Console MCP could run.

Figma's decision to build an official MCP server validated the entire concept of AI-powered design tooling. It proved that the design industry was ready for this. It opened the door for tools like ours to exist in a space that developers and designers already understood.

We're not here to compete with Figma. We're here to extend what's possible. The official MCP gives you a window into your designs. Figma Console MCP gives you the keys to the building.
